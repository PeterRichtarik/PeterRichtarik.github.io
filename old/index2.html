<h3> February 17, 2014 </h3>
         
<p>
This week I am in London, attending the <a href="http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~bm508/bigdata14.html">Big Data: Challenges and Applications</a> workshop at Imperial College. I have just listened to an interesting general talk By David Hand, and the announcement by Yike Guo of the new <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_6-12-2013-10-46-20">Data Science Institute</a> at Imperial. </p>

<p>In the afternoon I am giving a 3 hour <a href="talks/Tutorial-London-2014.ppsx">tutorial on Big Data Convex Optimization</a> (36MB file, sorry!). In the tutorial  I describe 8 first-order algorithms: gradient descent, projected gradient descent, proximal gradient descent, fast proximal gradient descent (essentially a new version of <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmechroom.technion.ac.il%2F~becka%2Fpapers%2F71654.pdf&ei=ggECU-3tI4aphAfsi4GoBA&usg=AFQjCNGuAEhwN1B11vVKlUU7SyQZIdbK8A&sig2=7aFZNniH2oeJMad0Hcqi4g&bvm=bv.61535280,d.ZG4">FISTA</a>), <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0614-z#">randomized coordinate descent</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0873">parallel coordinate descent (PCDM)</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2059">distributed coordinate descent (Hydra)</a> and, finally, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5799">fast parallel coordinate descent (APPROX)</a>. 
</p>

<img src="imgs/8-in-1-chart.png" width="654" height="471" longdesc="imgs/8-in-1-chart.png">
<p>
  As the above chart shows, all algorithms arise as special cases of the last one, which we call APPROX (joint work with <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~ofercoq/">Olivier Fercoq</a>). This is the first time such a synthesis is possible.</p>

<p>
I am launching a new seminar series (co-organized with <a href="http://jakubkonecny.com/">Jakub Konečný</a>): <span class="important">All Hands Meetings on Big Data Optimization.</span> </p>


<p>The idea is to meet for up to an hour, eat a pizza (or some other food, provided) and listen to someone giving an informal (perhaps blackboard) talk and leading a discussion about a recent paper on the topic of big data optimization. Discussions are encouraged throughout - and hence it would be nice (but certainly not required!) if participants could have (at least a brief) look at the paper beforehand. </p>

<h3> December 19, 2013 </h3>
         
<p><span class="important">New paper is out:</span> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5799">Accelerated, Parallel and Proximal Coordinate Descent</a> (joint with <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~ofercoq/">Olivier Fercoq</a>).</p>

<p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a new stochastic coordinate descent method for minimizing the sum of convex functions each of which depends on a small number of coordinates only. <strong>Our method (APPROX) is simultaneously Accelerated, Parallel and PROXimal</strong>; this is the first time such a method is proposed. In the special case when the number of processors is equal to the number of coordinates, the method converges at the rate <strong>$2\bar{\omega}\bar{L} R^2/(k+2)^2$</strong>, where $k$ is the iteration counter, \bar{\omega} is an <em>average</em> degree of separability of the loss function, $\bar{L}$ is the <em>average</em> of  Lipschitz constants associated with the coordinates and  individual functions in the sum, and $R$ is the distance of the initial point from the minimizer. We show that the  method can be implemented <strong>without the need to perform full-dimensional vector operations</strong>, which is considered to be the major bottleneck of accelerated coordinate descent.  The fact that the method depends on the average degree of separability, and not on the maximum degree of separability, can be attributed to the use of <strong>new safe large stepsizes</strong>, leading to improved expected separable overapproximation (ESO). These are of independent interest and can be utilized in all existing parallel stochastic coordinate descent algorithms based on the concept of ESO. </p>

<p>
We propose S2GD: a method belonging to second-generation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, combining the stability of gradient descent and computational efficiency of SGD. The method runs in several epochs, in each of which a full gradient is first computed, and then a random number of stochastic gradients are evaluated, following a geometric law. The <a href="http://media.nips.cc/nipsbooks/nipspapers/paper_files/nips26/238.pdf">SVRG method of Johnson and Zhang</a> arises as a special case.

</p> 

<p>
We also propose S2GD+, which in our experiments substantially outperforms all methods we tested, incuding S2GD, SGD and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6258">SAG (Stochastic Average Gradient) of Le Roux, Schmidt and Bach</a>.

<p> <em>Abstract:</em> We propose a novel topic discovery algorithm for unlabeled images based on the bag-of-words (BoW) framework. We first extract a dictionary of visual words and subsequently for each image compute a visual word occurrence histogram. We view these histograms as rows of a large matrix from which we extract sparse principal components (PCs). Each PC identifies a sparse combination of visual words which co-occur frequently in some images but seldom appear in others. Each sparse PC corresponds to a topic, and images whose interference with the PC is high belong to that topic, revealing the common parts possessed by the images. We propose to solve the associated sparse PCA problems using an Alternating Maximization (AM) method, which we modify for purpose of efficiently extracting multiple PCs in a deflation scheme. Our approach attacks the maximization problem in sparse PCA directly and is scalable to high-dimensional data. Experiments on automatic topic discovery and category prediction demonstrate encouraging performance of our approach. </p>

<p><span class="important">New short paper is out:</span> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3438">On optimal probabilities in stochastic coordinate descent methods.</a> Joint work with <a href="http://mtakac.com/index.php/">Martin Takáč</a>. </p>

<p>We propose and analyze a new parallel coordinate descent method---<span class="important">`NSync</span>---in which at each iteration a random subset of coordinates is updated, in parallel, allowing for the subsets to be chosen <em>non-uniformly</em>. Surprisingly, the strategy of updating a single randomly selected coordinate per iteration---with <em>optimal probabilities</em>---may require less iterations, both in theory and practice, than the strategy of updating all coordinates at every iteration.
 </p>
 
 <p> We believe this text is ideal as a quick point of entry to the subject of parallel coordinate descent.

 <p><span class="important">New paper announcement:</span> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5885">Smooth minimization of nonsmooth functions with parallel coordinate descent methods</a>. This is joint work with <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~ofercoq/">Olivier Fercoq</a>. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In this paper we show that parallel coordinate descent methods can be applied to a fairly general class of nonsmooth convex optimization problems and prove that the number of iterations decreases as  more processors are used. The class of functions includes, as special cases, L1 regularized L1 regression, L-infinity regression and the &quot;AdaBoost&quot; problem (minimization of the exponential loss).
 </p>
 
 
 <p>  The first 5 pages give a brief tutorial on coordinate descent and on the issues related to making the method parallel.

<p>Fresh from the bakery,  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5530">Inexact coordinate descent: complexity and preconditioning</a> is a new paper, coauthored with Jacek Gondzio and Rachael Tappenden. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Brief blurb:</em> We prove complexity bounds for a randomized block coordinate descet method in which the proximal step defining an iteration is performed inexactly. This is often useful in the case when blocks contain more than a single variable - we illustrate this on the example of minimizing a quadratic function with explicit block structure.

  <p>
 <em>Brief blurb:</em> We parallelize Pegasos (stochastic subgradient descent) and SDCA (stochastic dual coordinate ascent) for support vector machines and prove that the theoretical parallelization speedup factor of both methods is the same, and depends on the spectral norm of the data. The SDCA approach is primal-dual in nature, our guarantees are given in terms of the original hinge loss formulation of SVMs.<p>
