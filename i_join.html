          I am always looking for outstanding and
          highly motivated people to join my team. At the moment I am
          hiring interns, MS &amp; PhD students, postdocs and research
          scientists in the following areas:

          <ul>
          <li> optimization for machine learning </li>
          <li> theory of deep learning </li>
          <li> <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html">federated learning</a> (I am co-inventor of FL: <a

          </ul>

          <h1>Interns</h1>

          If you would like to visit my Lab as an intern, send me an
          email and explain why you are interested in this. Include a CV
          and a transcript of university grades. Interns can spend
          anywhere between several weeks to 6 months at KAUST. We have
          several internship programs, including:

          <ol>

          <li> <a href="https://vsrp.kaust.edu.sa"> VSRP</a> (Visiting Student Research Program)

          <ul>

          <li> 3-6 months stay requirement</li>

          <li> eligible regions/countries: Europe (this includes Turkey and Russia), North America (USA &amp; Canada), Australasia (Australia &amp; NZ), Latin America, South Korea, Japan, Singapore. </li>

        <li> I have 4 VSRP projects open: i) <a href="https://vsrp.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Gradient%20compression%20for%20distributed%20training%20of%20machine%20learning%20models.aspx">Gradient compression for distributed training of machine learning models</a>, ii) <a href="https://vsrp.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Towards%20a%20Principled%20Understanding%20of%20Deep%20Learning.aspx">Towards a principled understanding of deep learning</a>, iii) <a

        </ul>

      </li>


          <li> VS (Visiting Student program)
            <ul>
               <li> 1-6 months stay requirement
               <li> eligible countries: all
            </ul>
        </li>

          <li> <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ssi">SSI</a> (Saudi Summer Internships)
            <ul>
              <li> competitive program with up to 40 spaces each Summer at  KAUST</li>
              <li> eligibility: i) in-kingdom Saudi nationals ii) should be university students studying towards an MS degree, or be in their junior or senior year iii) should pursue a degree related to CS/MATH/STAT/EE.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


      </ol>


          Should I get interested in your profile, I will direct you to
          the right program. Internships come complete with a
          salary/stipend, flight ticket, free on-campus accommodation,
          health insurance, and visa fee reimbursement.<br>
          <br>





          <h1>MS/PhD and PhD positions</h1>

          If you have a BS degree, apply to our combined MS/PhD program.
          If all goes well, you will get an MS degree in 1.5 years (3
          semesters), and will then continue towards your PhD. So, if
          you start in August in year Y, you will get your MS degree in
          December in year Y+1, and will continue as a PhD student from
          January of year Y+2. If you have an MS degree already, apply
          directly to the PhD program. If you are from Europe, I recommend that you also apply
          for the <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/alkhwarizmi">European Science Foundation Al Khwarizmi Doctoral Fellowship</a> - this is more prestigious than the standard KAUST Fellowship.
          PhD at KAUST takes a minimum of
          2.5 years. We accept students for entry in Fall (August) and
          Spring (January). However, most students start in the Fall.
          There are several application rounds throughout the year, and
          hence you can essentially apply at any time. <a
            href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/applying-to-kaust">Apply here.</a><br>
          <br>
          I can supervise students in all programs in the <a
            href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa">CEMSE division</a>: <a
            href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/amcs">AMCS</a> (Applied
          Mathematics &amp; Computational Science), <a
            href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cs">CS</a> (Computer
          Science), <a href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ee">EE</a>
          (Electrical Engineering) and <a
            href="https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stat">STAT</a>
          (Statistics). My current students study in all of these
          programs except for EE.<br>
          <br>



          <h1>Postdocs and Research Scientists
          </h1>

          I always have postdoc and research scientist positions open
          for outstanding applicants. The initial application process is
          quite informal. Send to me your CV, transcript of grades and
          explain why you are interested to join my team. If I like your
          profile, I will ask you to secure 2-3 reference letters to be
          sent directly to me (if you have letters written for you
          already, feel free to ask your letter writers to send their
          letters to me right away). Should your application get
          shortlisted, a Skype interview will be arranged.<br>
