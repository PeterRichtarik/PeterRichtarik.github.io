<h2>Prof. Stephen Wright</h2>
<p>Steve Wright is a Professor of Computer Science at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He works in the area of computational optimization and its applications to science and engineering. His recent research interests include
  the development of algorithms and theory for sparse optimization, compressed sensing and
  machine learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to joining UW-Madison in 2001, Prof Wright was a Senior Computer Scientist (1997-2001) and Computer Scientist (1990-1997)
  at Argonne National Laboratory and Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago (2000-2001). Prior to that he has held positions at the North Carolina State University and University of Arizona.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Wright is the past Chair of the Mathematical Optimization
  Society (formerly the Mathematical Programming Society), the leading professional society in optimization,
  and is a Fellow and a member of the Board of Trustees of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is the
  author or coauthor of several widely used books in numerical optimization, including "Primal-Dual Interior-Point
  Methods" (SIAM, 1997) and "Numerical Optimization"
  (with J. Nocedal, Second Edition, Springer, 2006). He is
  coauthor of widely used interior-point software for linear
  and quadratic optimization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Google Scholar the works of Prof Wright have a total
  of more than 18,000 citations. His 2009 paper "Sparse reconstruction by   separable approximation" won a best paper award from the IEEE Signal   Processing Society in 2011.</p>
