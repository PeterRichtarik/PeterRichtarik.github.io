"BiCoLoR: Communication-Efficient Optimization with Bidirectional Compression and Local Training"</a> -
joint work with Laurent Condat and Artavazd Maranjyan.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Slow and costly communication is often the main bottleneck in distributed optimization, especially in federated learning where it occurs over wireless networks. We introduce BiCoLoR, a communication-efficient optimization algorithm that combines two widely used and effective strategies: local training, which increases computation between communication rounds, and compression, which encodes high-dimensional vectors into short bitstreams. While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors. This joint design achieves accelerated complexity guarantees in both convex and strongly convex heterogeneous settings. Empirically, BiCoLoR outperforms existing algorithms and establishes a new standard in communication efficiency.</i>

"First Provable Guarantees for Practical Private FL: Beyond Restrictive Assumptions"</a> -
joint work with Egor Shulgin, Grigory Malinovsky, and Sarit Khirirat.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-α-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-α-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.</i>

"Tight Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Nonconvex Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise"</a> -
joint work with Adrien Fradin, Abdurakhmon Sadiev, and Laurent Condat.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>We study stochastic nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. In this setting, the stochastic gradients only have bounded p--th central moment (p--BCM) for some p∈(1,2]. Building on the foundational work of Arjevani et al. (2022) in stochastic optimization, we establish tight sample complexity lower bounds for all first-order methods under relaxed mean-squared smoothness (q-WAS) and δ-similarity ((q,δ)-S) assumptions, allowing any exponent q∈[1,2] instead of the standard q=2. These results substantially broaden the scope of existing lower bounds. To complement them, we show that Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum Variance Reduction (NSGD-MVR), a known algorithm, matches these bounds in expectation. Beyond expectation guarantees, we introduce a new algorithm, Double-Clipped NSGD-MVR, which allows the derivation of high-probability convergence rates under weaker assumptions than previous works. Finally, for second-order methods with stochastic Hessians satisfying bounded q-th central moment assumptions for some exponent q∈[1,2] (allowing q≠p), we establish sharper lower bounds than previous works while improving over Sadiev et al. (2025) (where only p=q is considered) and yielding stronger convergence exponents. Together, these results provide a nearly complete complexity characterization of stochastic nonconvex optimization in heavy-tailed regimes.</i>

"Muon is Provably Faster with Momentum Variance Reduction"</a> -
joint work with Xun Qian, Hussein Rammal, and Dmitry Kovalev.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Recent empirical research has demonstrated that deep learning optimizers based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO) over specifically chosen Non-Euclidean norm balls, such as Muon and Scion, outperform Adam-type methods in the training of large language models. In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from O(1/K^{1/4}) to O(1/K^{1/3}). Additionally, we provide improved rates in the star-convex case. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments that verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of iteration complexity.</i>

"Better LMO-based Momentum Methods with Second-Order Information"</a> -
joint work with Sarit Khirirat, Abdurakhmon Sadiev, and Yury Demidovich.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>The use of momentum in stochastic optimization algorithms has shown empirical success across a range of machine learning tasks. Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the O(K^{-1/4}) rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of O(K^{-1/3}) for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations.</i>

The Fall semester just ended at KAUST. Next week is the exam week, so it's not all over yet! The final exam for my CS 331 ("Stochastic gradient descent methods") class will be pen-and-paper only; no electronic devices allowed. With weekly assignments that take 3 days to complete on average, the workload for this course is heavy, and the course should really be worth 6 credits instead of 3. On the other hand, the students learned a lot, and will reap the 

Teaching-wise, this has been the busiest semester for me so far: I have taught 3 courses, and run the CS graduate seminar.

"Improved Convergence in Parameter-Agnostic Error Feedback through Momentum"</a> -
joint work with Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Yury Demidovich, Igor Sokolov, Grigory Malinovsky, and Sarit Khirirat.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near $O(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, $O(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and $O(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum. Our results hold with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches. Finally, our empirical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.</i>

"Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update"</a> -
joint work with Egor Shulgin, Sultan AlRashed, and Francesco Orabona.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists: Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling, with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision changes.</i>

"Second-order Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Hessian Clipping and Sample Complexity Limits"</a> -
joint work with Abdurakhmon Sadiev and Ilyas Fatkhullin.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications, arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and Hessians have only bounded p-th moments, for some p ∈ (1,2], and establish tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed regimes.</i>

"Drop-Muon: Update Less, Converge Faster"</a> -
joint work with Kaja Gruntkowska, Yassine Maziane, and Zheng Qu.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise smoothness and layer-wise (L0,L1)-smoothness, covering deterministic and stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to 1.4x faster in wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.</i>

"Non-Euclidean Broximal Point Method: A Blueprint for Geometry-Aware Optimization"</a> -
joint work with Kaja Gruntkowska.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>The recently proposed Broximal Point Method (BPM) [Gruntkowska et al., 2025] offers an idealized optimization framework based on iteratively minimizing the objective function over norm balls centered at the current iterate. It enjoys striking global convergence guarantees, converging linearly and in a finite number of steps for proper, closed and convex functions. However, its theoretical analysis has so far been confined to the Euclidean geometry. At the same time, emerging trends in deep learning optimization, exemplified by algorithms such as Muon [Jordan et al., 2024] and Scion [Pethick et al., 2025], demonstrate the practical advantages of minimizing over balls defined via non-Euclidean norms which better align with the underlying geometry of the associated loss landscapes. In this note, we ask whether the convergence theory of BPM can be extended to this more general, non-Euclidean setting. We give a positive answer, showing that most of the elegant guarantees of the original method carry over to arbitrary norm geometries. Along the way, we clarify which properties are preserved and which necessarily break down when leaving the Euclidean realm. Our analysis positions Non-Euclidean BPM as a conceptual blueprint for understanding a broad class of geometry-aware optimization algorithms, shedding light on the principles behind their practical effectiveness.</i>

"Error Feedback for Muon and Friends"</a> -
joint work with Kaja Gruntkowska, Alexander Gaponov, and Zhirayr Tovmasyan.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles (LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more general (L_0,L_1)-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to 7x communication savings with no accuracy degradation.</i>

Abstract: <i>We revisit the classical Local SGD and Federated Averaging (FedAvg) methods for distributed optimization and federated learning. While prior work has primarily focused on iteration complexity, we analyze these methods through the lens of time complexity, taking into account both computation and communication costs. Our analysis reveals that, despite its favorable iteration complexity, the time complexity of canonical Local SGD is provably worse than that of Minibatch SGD and Hero SGD (locally executed SGD). We introduce a corrected variant, Dual Local SGD, and further improve it by increasing the local step sizes, leading to a new method called Decaying Local SGD. Our analysis shows that these modifications, together with Hero SGD, are optimal in the nonconvex setting (up to logarithmic factors), closing the time complexity gap. Finally, we use these insights to improve the theory of a number of other asynchronous and local methods.</i>

"Ringleader ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity under Data Heterogeneity"</a> -
joint work with Artavazd Maranjyan.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.</i>

"Bernoulli-LoRA: A Theoretical Framework for Randomized Low-Rank Adaptation"</a> -
joint work with Igor Sokolov, Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Yury Demidovich, and Fawaz S Al-Qahtani.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity, expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA (arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work, we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE, Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes. Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT methods.</i>

"Gluon: Making Muon & Scion Great Again! (Bridging Theory and Practice of LMO-based Optimizers for LLMs)"</a> -
joint work with Artem Riabinin, Egor Shulgin, and Kaja Gruntkowska.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as 𝖬𝗎𝗈𝗇 and 𝖲𝖼𝗂𝗈𝗇. After over a decade of 𝖠𝖽𝖺𝗆's dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training. However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called 𝖦𝗅𝗎𝗈𝗇, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of 𝖬𝗎𝗈𝗇 and 𝖲𝖼𝗂𝗈𝗇, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025). Our experiments with NanoGPT and CNN confirm that our assumption holds along the optimization trajectory, ultimately closing the gap between theory and practice.</i>

"The Stochastic Multi-Proximal Method for Nonsmooth Optimization"</a> -
joint work with Laurent Condat and Elnur Gasanov.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Stochastic gradient descent type methods are ubiquitous in machine learning, but they are only applicable to the optimization of differentiable functions. Proximal algorithms are more general and applicable to nonsmooth functions. We propose a new stochastic and variance-reduced algorithm, the Stochastic Multi-Proximal Method (SMPM), in which the proximity operators of a (possibly empty) random subset of functions are called at every iteration, according to an arbitrary sampling distribution. Several existing algorithms, including Point-SAGA (2016), Proxskip (2022) and RandProx-Minibatch (2023) are recovered as particular cases. We derive linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity and smoothness or similarity of the functions. We prove convergence in the general convex case and accelerated O(1/t^2) convergence with varying stepsizes in presence of strong convexity solely. Our results are new even for the above special cases. Moreover, we show an application to distributed optimization with compressed communication, outperforming existing methods.</i>

Abstract: <i>This paper presents Thanos, a novel weight-pruning algorithm designed to reduce the memory footprint and enhance the computational efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by removing redundant weights while maintaining accuracy. Thanos introduces a block-wise pruning strategy with adaptive masks that dynamically adjust to weight importance, enabling flexible sparsity patterns and structured formats, such as n:m sparsity, optimized for hardware acceleration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Thanos achieves state-of-the-art performance in structured pruning and outperforms existing methods in unstructured pruning. By providing an efficient and adaptable approach to model compression, Thanos offers a practical solution for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments.</i>

"Collaborative Value Function Estimation Under Model Mismatch: A Federated Temporal Difference Analysis"</a> -
joint work with Ali Beikmohammadi, Sarit Khirirat, and Sindri Magnússon.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy by preventing direct data exchange between agents. However, many existing FedRL algorithms assume that all agents operate in identical environments, which is often unrealistic. In real-world applications -- such as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor networks -- each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics, leading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear convergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in policy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent suffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value function. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes. We then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where multiple agents -- each interacting with its own perturbed environment -- periodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true value function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate the impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the convergence of FedTD(0). Empirical experiments corroborate our theoretical gains, highlighting that even moderate levels of information sharing can significantly mitigate environment-specific errors.</i>

"BurTorch: Revisiting Training from First Principles by Coupling Autodiff, Math Optimization, and Systems"</a> -
joint work with Konstantin Burlachenko.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>In this work, we introduce BurTorch, a compact high-performance framework designed to optimize Deep Learning (DL) training on single-node workstations through an exceptionally efficient CPU-based backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Linnainmaa, 1970) implementation. Although modern DL frameworks rely on compilerlike optimizations internally, BurTorch takes a different path. It adopts a minimalist design and demonstrates that, in these circumstances, classical compiled programming languages can play a significant role in DL research. By eliminating the overhead of large frameworks and making efficient implementation choices, BurTorch achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance and memory efficiency when computing ∇f(x) on a CPU. BurTorch features a compact codebase designed to achieve two key goals simultaneously. First, it provides a user experience similar to script-based programming environments. Second, it dramatically minimizes runtime overheads. In large DL frameworks, the primary source of memory overhead for relatively small computation graphs f(x) is due to feature-heavy implementations. We benchmarked BurTorch against widely used DL frameworks in their execution modes: JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016); and several standalone libraries: Autograd (Maclaurin et al., 2015), Micrograd (Karpathy, 2020), Apple MLX (Hannun et al., 2023). For small compute graphs, BurTorch outperforms best-practice solutions by up to ×2000 in runtime and reduces memory consumption by up to ×3500. For a miniaturized GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020), BurTorch achieves up to a ×20 speedup and reduces memory up to ×80 compared to PyTorch.</i>

"Smoothed Normalization for Efficient Distributed Private Optimization"</a> -
joint work with Egor Shulgin and Sarit Khirirat.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Federated learning enables training machine learning models while preserving the privacy of participants. Surprisingly, there is no differentially private distributed method for smooth, non-convex optimization problems. The reason is that standard privacy techniques require bounding the participants' contributions, usually enforced via clipping of the updates. Existing literature typically ignores the effect of clipping by assuming the boundedness of gradient norms or analyzes distributed algorithms with clipping but ignores DP constraints. In this work, we study an alternative approach via smoothed normalization of the updates motivated by its favorable performance in the single-node setting. By integrating smoothed normalization with an error-feedback mechanism, we design a new distributed algorithm α-𝖭𝗈𝗋𝗆𝖤𝖢. We prove that our method achieves a superior convergence rate over prior works. By extending α-𝖭𝗈𝗋𝗆𝖤𝖢 to the DP setting, we obtain the first differentially private distributed optimization algorithm with provable convergence guarantees. Finally, our empirical results from neural network training indicate robust convergence of α-𝖭𝗈𝗋𝗆𝖤𝖢 across different parameter settings.</i>

"A Novel Unified Parametric Assumption for Nonconvex Optimization"</a> -
joint work with Artem Riabinin and Ahmed Khaled.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Nonconvex optimization is central to modern machine learning, but the general framework of nonconvex optimization yields weak convergence guarantees that are too pessimistic compared to practice. On the other hand, while convexity enables efficient optimization, it is of limited applicability to many practical problems. To bridge this gap and better understand the practical success of optimization algorithms in nonconvex settings, we introduce a novel unified parametric assumption. Our assumption is general enough to encompass a broad class of nonconvex functions while also being specific enough to enable the derivation of a unified convergence theorem for gradient-based methods. Notably, by tuning the parameters of our assumption, we demonstrate its versatility in recovering several existing function classes as special cases and in identifying functions amenable to efficient optimization. We derive our convergence theorem for both deterministic and stochastic optimization, and conduct experiments to verify that our assumption can hold practically over optimization trajectories.</i>

"Double Momentum and Error Feedback for Clipping with Fast Rates and Differential Privacy"</a> -
joint work with Rustem Islamov, Samuel Horváth, Aurelien Lucchi, and Eduard Gorbunov.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Strong Differential Privacy (DP) and Optimization guarantees are two desirable properties for a method in Federated Learning (FL). However, existing algorithms do not achieve both properties at once: they either have optimal DP guarantees but rely on restrictive assumptions such as bounded gradients/bounded data heterogeneity, or they ensure strong optimization performance but lack DP guarantees. To address this gap in the literature, we propose and analyze a new method called Clip21-SGD2M based on a novel combination of clipping, heavy-ball momentum, and Error Feedback. In particular, for non-convex smooth distributed problems with clients having arbitrarily heterogeneous data, we prove that Clip21-SGD2M has optimal convergence rate and also near optimal (local-)DP neighborhood. Our numerical experiments on non-convex logistic regression and training of neural networks highlight the superiority of Clip21-SGD2M over baselines in terms of the optimization performance for a given DP-budget.</i>

"Revisiting Stochastic Proximal Point Methods: Generalized Smoothness and Similarity"</a> -
joint work with Zhirayr Tovmasyan, Grigory Malinovsky, and Laurent Condat.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>The growing prevalence of nonsmooth optimization problems in machine learning has spurred significant interest in generalized smoothness assumptions. Among these, the (L0,L1)-smoothness assumption has emerged as one of the most prominent. While proximal methods are well-suited and effective for nonsmooth problems in deterministic settings, their stochastic counterparts remain underexplored. This work focuses on the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM), valued for its stability and minimal hyperparameter tuning -- advantages often missing in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We propose a novel phi-smoothness framework and provide a comprehensive analysis of SPPM without relying on traditional smoothness assumptions. Our results are highly general, encompassing existing findings as special cases. Furthermore, we examine SPPM under the widely adopted expected similarity assumption, thereby extending its applicability to a broader range of scenarios. Our theoretical contributions are illustrated and validated by practical experiments.</i>

"The Ball-Proximal (="Broximal") Point Method: a New Algorithm, Convergence Theory, and Applications"</a> -
joint work with Kaja Gruntkowska, Hanmin Li, and Aadi Rane.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Non-smooth and non-convex global optimization poses significant challenges across various applications, where standard gradient-based methods often struggle. We propose the Ball-Proximal Point Method, Broximal Point Method, or Ball Point Method (BPM) for short - a novel algorithmic framework inspired by the classical Proximal Point Method (PPM) (Rockafellar, 1976), which, as we show, sheds new light on several foundational optimization paradigms and phenomena, including non-convex and non-smooth optimization, acceleration, smoothing, adaptive stepsize selection, and trust-region methods. At the core of BPM lies the ball-proximal ("broximal") operator, which arises from the classical proximal operator by replacing the quadratic distance penalty by a ball constraint. Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast with the sublinear rate of PPM in the nonsmooth convex regime, we prove that BPM converges linearly and in a finite number of steps in the same regime. Furthermore, by introducing the concept of ball-convexity, we prove that BPM retains the same global convergence guarantees under weaker assumptions, making it a powerful tool for a broader class of potentially non-convex optimization problems. Just like PPM plays the role of a conceptual method inspiring the development of practically efficient algorithms and algorithmic elements, e.g., gradient descent, adaptive step sizes, acceleration (Ahn & Sra, 2020), and "W" in AdamW (Zhuang et al., 2022), we believe that BPM should be understood in the same manner: as a blueprint and inspiration for further development.</i>

"ATA: Adaptive Task Allocation for Efficient Resource Management in Distributed Machine Learning"</a> -
joint work with Artavazd Maranjyan, El Mehdi Saad, and Francesco Orabona.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Asynchronous methods are fundamental for parallelizing computations in distributed machine learning. They aim to accelerate training by fully utilizing all available resources. However, their greedy approach can lead to inefficiencies using more computation than required, especially when computation times vary across devices. If the computation times were known in advance, training could be fast and resource-efficient by assigning more tasks to faster workers. The challenge lies in achieving this optimal allocation without prior knowledge of the computation time distributions. In this paper, we propose ATA (Adaptive Task Allocation), a method that adapts to heterogeneous and random distributions of worker computation times. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we show that ATA identifies the optimal task allocation and performs comparably to methods with prior knowledge of computation times. Experimental results further demonstrate that ATA is resource-efficient, significantly reducing costs compared to the greedy approach, which can be arbitrarily expensive depending on the number of workers.</i>

"Symmetric Pruning of Large Language Models"</a> -
joint work with Kai Yi.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Popular post-training pruning methods such as Wanda and RIA are known for their simple, yet effective, designs that have shown exceptional empirical performance. Wanda optimizes performance through calibrated activations during pruning, while RIA emphasizes the relative, rather than absolute, importance of weight elements. Despite their practical success, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining these outcomes has been lacking. This paper introduces new theoretical insights that redefine the standard minimization objective for pruning, offering a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to their success. Our study extends beyond these insights by proposing complementary strategies that consider both input activations and weight significance. We validate these approaches through rigorous experiments, demonstrating substantial enhancements over existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training-free fine-tuning approach R^2-DSnoT that incorporates relative weight importance and a regularized decision boundary within a dynamic pruning-and-growing framework, significantly outperforming strong baselines and establishing a new state of the art.</i>

"Ringmaster ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity"</a> -
joint work with Artavazd Maranjyan and Alexander Tyurin.
<br>
<br>
  
Abstract: <i>Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (Asynchronous SGD) is a cornerstone method for parallelizing learning in distributed machine learning. However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12387">Tyurin & Richtárik (NeurIPS 2023) </a>reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</i>
