"Improving the Worst-Case Bidirectional Communication Complexity for Nonconvex Distributed Optimization under Function Similarity"</a> -
joint work with Kaja Gruntkowska and Alexander Tyurin.
 <br>
 <br>
  
Abstract: <i> Effective communication between the server and workers plays a key role in distributed optimization. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the server-to-worker communication, uncovering inefficiencies in prevalent downlink compression approaches. Considering first the pure setup where the uplink communication costs are negligible, we introduce MARINA-P, a novel method for downlink compression, employing a collection of correlated compressors. Theoretical analyses demonstrates that MARINA-P with permutation compressors can achieve a server-to-worker communication complexity improving with the number of workers, thus being provably superior to existing algorithms. We further show that MARINA-P can serve as a starting point for extensions such as methods supporting bidirectional compression. We introduce M3, a method combining MARINA-P with uplink compression and a momentum step, achieving bidirectional compression with provable improvements in total communication complexity as the number of workers increases. Theoretical findings align closely with empirical experiments, underscoring the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. </i>

"Shadowheart SGD: Distributed Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity Under Arbitrary Computation and Communication Heterogeneity"</a> -
joint work with Alexander Tyurin, Marta Pozzi, and Ivan Ilin.
 <br>
 <br>
  
Abstract: <i> We consider nonconvex stochastic optimization problems in the asynchronous centralized distributed setup where the communication times from workers to a server can not be ignored, and the computation and communication times are potentially different for all workers. Using an unbiassed compression technique, we develop a new method---Shadowheart SGD---that provably improves the time complexities of all previous centralized methods. Moreover, we show that the time complexity of Shadowheart SGD is optimal in the family of centralized methods with compressed communication. We also consider the bidirectional setup, where broadcasting from the server to the workers is non-negligible, and develop a corresponding method. </i>

<h1>Kaja Gruntkowska: New PhD Student!</h1>

A new PhD student (in Statistics) arrived to join my team today: Kaja Gruntkowska (MS from Oxford). 

<br>
<br>
Kaja interned in my lab in Summer 2022 as an undergraduate research student coming from Warwick. The internship was fruitful; Kaja, Alexander Tyurin and I coauthored a super nice paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15218">"EF21-P and friends: Improved theoretical communication complexity for distributed optimization with bidirectional compression"</a>, published in ICML 2023. You can listen to Kaja's University of Birmingham seminar talk on this topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzBrLqV6Fxc">YouTube.</a> 

<br>
<br>
Kaja then joined Oxford as an MS student in Fall 2022, and I supervised her thesis a part of which appeared in another super nice paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09804">"Communication compression for Byzantine robust learning: New efficient algorithms and improved rates"</a>, coauthored with Ahmad Rammal, Nikita Fedin, and Eduard Gorbunov, and recently accepted to AISTATS 2024. 

<br>
<br>
Kaja and I thought it was a good idea for her to conduct a second (this time remote) internship, and this effort eventually turned into another beautiful paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06412">"Improving the worst-case bidirectional communication complexity for nonconvex distributed optimization under function similarity"</a>, coauthored with Alexander Tyurin. 

<br>
<br>
  
Kaja, welcome! A nice way to start your PhD with three papers in the pocket!

"Federated Learning is Better with Non-homomorphic Encryption"</a> -
joint work with Konstantin Burlachenko, Abdulmajeed Alrowithi, and Fahad Ali Albalawi.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i> Traditional AI methodologies necessitate centralized data collection, which becomes impractical when facing problems with network communication, data privacy, or storage capacity. Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm that empowers distributed AI model training without collecting raw data. There are different choices for providing privacy during FL training. One of the popular methodologies is employing Homomorphic Encryption (HE) - a breakthrough in privacy-preserving computation from Cryptography. However, these methods have a price in the form of extra computation and memory footprint. To resolve these issues, we propose an innovative framework that synergizes permutation-based compressors with Classical Cryptography, even though employing Classical Cryptography was assumed to be impossible in the past in the context of FL. Our framework offers a way to replace HE with cheaper Classical Cryptography primitives which provides security for the training process. It fosters asynchronous communication and provides flexible deployment options in various communication topologies. </i>

"MAST: Model-Agnostic Sparsified Training"</a> -
joint work with Yury Demidovich, Grigory Malinovsky, and Egor Shulgin.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i> We introduce a novel optimization problem formulation that departs from the conventional way of minimizing machine learning model loss as a black-box function. Unlike traditional formulations, the proposed approach explicitly incorporates an initially pre-trained model and random sketch operators, allowing for sparsification of both the model and gradient during training. We establish insightful properties of the proposed objective function and highlight its connections to the standard formulation. Furthermore, we present several variants of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method adapted to the new problem formulation, including SGD with general sampling, a distributed version, and SGD with variance reduction techniques. We achieve tighter convergence rates and relax assumptions, bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, covering several important techniques such as Dropout and Sparse training. This work presents promising opportunities to enhance the theoretical understanding of model training through a sparsification-aware optimization approach. </i>

"Byzantine Robustness and Partial Participation Can Be Achieved Simultaneously: Just Clip Gradient Differences"</a> -
joint work with Grigory Malinovsky, Samuel Horváth, and Eduard Gorbunov.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i> Distributed learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for training large machine learning models. However, in real-world scenarios, participants may be unreliable or malicious, posing a significant challenge to the integrity and accuracy of the trained models. Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, but they often assume full participation from all clients, which is not always practical due to the unavailability of some clients or communication constraints. In our work, we propose the first distributed method with client sampling and provable tolerance to Byzantine workers. The key idea behind the developed method is the use of gradient clipping to control stochastic gradient differences in recursive variance reduction. This allows us to bound the potential harm caused by Byzantine workers, even during iterations when all sampled clients are Byzantine. Furthermore, we incorporate communication compression into the method to enhance communication efficiency. Under quite general assumptions, we prove convergence rates for the proposed method that match the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) theoretical results. </i>

"Consensus-Based Optimization with Truncated Noise"</a> -
joint work with Massimo Fornasier, Konstantin Riedl, and Lukang Sun.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i>Consensus-based optimization~(CBO) is a versatile multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method suitable for performing nonconvex and nonsmooth global optimizations in high dimensions. It has proven effective in various applications while at the same time being amenable to a theoretical convergence analysis. In this paper, we explore a variant of CBO, which incorporates truncated noise in order to enhance the well-behavedness of the statistics of the law of the dynamics. By introducing this additional truncation in the noise term of the CBO dynamics, we achieve that, in contrast to the original version, higher moments of the law of the particle system can be effectively bounded. As a result, our proposed variant exhibits enhanced convergence performance, allowing in particular for wider flexibility in choosing the parameters of the method as we confirm experimentally. By analyzing the time-evolution of the Wasserstein-2 distance between the empirical measure of the interacting particle system and the global minimizer of the objective function, we rigorously prove convergence in expectation of the proposed CBO variant requiring only minimal assumptions on the objective function and on the initialization. Numerical evidences clearly demonstrate the benefit of truncating the noise in CBO.</i>

"Communication Compression for Byzantine Robust Learning: New Efficient Algorithms and Improved Rates"</a> -
joint work with Ahmad Rammal, Kaja Gruntkowska, Nikita Fedin, and Eduard Gorbunov.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i>Byzantine robustness is an essential feature of algorithms for certain distributed optimization problems, typically encountered in collaborative/federated learning. These problems are usually huge-scale, implying that communication compression is also imperative for their resolution. These factors have spurred recent algorithmic and theoretical developments in the literature of Byzantine-robust learning with compression. In this paper, we contribute to this research area in two main directions. First, we propose a new Byzantine-robust method with compression -- Byz-DASHA-PAGE -- and prove that the new method has better convergence rate (for non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth optimization problems), smaller neighborhood size in the heterogeneous case, and tolerates more Byzantine workers under over-parametrization than the previous method with SOTA theoretical convergence guarantees (Byz-VR-MARINA). Secondly, we develop the first Byzantine-robust method with communication compression and error feedback -- Byz-EF21 -- along with its bidirectional compression version -- Byz-EF21-BC -- and derive the convergence rates for these methods for non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth case. We test the proposed methods and illustrate our theoretical findings in the numerical experiments.</i>

joint work with Hanmin Li and Avetik Karagulyan.

  <br>
  
Abstract: <i>Matrix-stepsized gradient descent algorithms have been demonstrated to exhibit superior efficiency in non-convex optimization compared to their scalar counterparts. The det-CGD algorithm, as introduced by Li et al. (2023), leverages matrix stepsizes to perform compressed gradient descent for non-convex objectives and matrix-smooth problems in a federated manner. The authors establish the algorithm's convergence to a neighborhood of the weighted stationarity point under a convex condition for the symmetric and positive-definite stepsize matrix. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced version of the det-CGD algorithm, incorporating the MARINA method. Notably, we establish theoretically and empirically, that det-MARINA outperforms both MARINA and the distributed det-CGD algorithms in terms of iteration and communication complexities.</i>

"High-Probability Convergence for Composite and Distributed Stochastic Minimization and Variational Inequalities with Heavy-Tailed Noise"</a> -
joint work with Eduard Gorbunov, Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Marina Danilova, Samuel Horváth, Gauthier Gidel, Pavel Dvurechensky, and Alexander Gasnikov.
 <br>
  <br>
  
Abstract: <i>High-probability analysis of stochastic first-order optimization methods under mild assumptions on the noise has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. Typically, gradient clipping is one of the key algorithmic ingredients to derive good high-probability guarantees when the noise is heavy-tailed. However, if implemented naïvely, clipping can spoil the convergence of the popular methods for composite and distributed optimization (Prox-SGD / Parallel SGD) even in the absence of any noise. Due to this reason, many works on high-probability analysis consider only unconstrained non-distributed problems, and the existing results for composite/distributed problems do not include some important special cases (like strongly convex problems) and are not optimal. To address this issue, we propose new stochastic methods for composite and distributed optimization based on the clipping of stochastic gradient differences and prove tight high-probability convergence results (including nearly optimal ones) for the new methods. Using similar ideas, we also develop new methods for composite and distributed variational inequalities and analyze the high-probability convergence of these methods.</i>

Abstract: <i>Modern advancements in large-scale machine learning would be impossible without the paradigm of data-parallel distributed computing. Since distributed computing with large-scale models imparts excessive pressure on communication channels, significant recent research has been directed toward co-designing communication compression strategies and training algorithms with the goal of reducing communication costs. While pure data parallelism allows better data scaling, it suffers from poor model scaling properties. Indeed, compute nodes are severely limited by memory constraints, preventing further increases in model size. For this reason, the latest achievements in training giant neural network models also rely on some form of model parallelism. In this work, we take a closer theoretical look at Independent Subnetwork Training (IST), which is a recently proposed and highly effective technique for solving the aforementioned problems. We identify fundamental differences between IST and alternative approaches, such as distributed methods with compressed communication, and provide a precise analysis of its optimization performance on a quadratic model.</i>

<a href="https://avetx.github.io">Avetik Karagulyan</a>.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Federated sampling algorithms have recently gained great popularity in the community of machine learning and statistics. This paper studies variants of such algorithms called Error Feedback Langevin algorithms (ELF). In particular, we analyze the combinations of EF21 and EF21-P with the federated Langevin Monte-Carlo. We propose three algorithms: P-ELF, D-ELF, and B-ELF that use, respectively, primal, dual, and bidirectional compressors. We analyze the proposed methods under Log-Sobolev inequality and provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In federated learning, a large number of users are involved in a global learning task, in a collaborative way. They alternate local computations and communication with a distant server. Communication, which can be slow and costly, is the main bottleneck in this setting. To accelerate distributed gradient descent, the popular strategy of local training is to communicate less frequently; that is, to perform several iterations of local computations between the communication steps. A recent breakthrough in this field was made by Mishchenko et al. (2022): their Scaffnew algorithm is the first to probably benefit from local training, with accelerated communication complexity. However, it was an open and challenging question to know whether the powerful mechanism behind Scaffnew would be compatible with partial participation, the desirable feature that not all clients need to participate to every round of the training process. We answer this question positively and propose a new algorithm, which handles local training and partial participation, with state-of-the-art communication complexity.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients work together to solve a machine learning task. One of the key challenges in FL is the issue of partial participation, which occurs when a large number of clients are involved in the training process. The traditional method to address this problem is randomly selecting a subset of clients at each communication round. In our research, we propose a new technique and design a novel regularized client participation scheme. Under this scheme, each client joins the learning process every R communication rounds, which we refer to as a meta epoch. We have found that this participation scheme leads to a reduction in the variance caused by client sampling. Combined with the popular FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017), it results in superior rates under standard assumptions. For instance, the optimization term in our main convergence bound decreases linearly with the product of the number of communication rounds and the size of the local dataset of each client, and the statistical term scales with step size quadratically instead of linearly (the case for client sampling with replacement), leading to better convergence rate O(1/T^2) compared to O(1/T), where T is the total number of communication rounds. Furthermore, our results permit arbitrary client availability as long as each client is available for training once per each meta epoch..

Abstract:
<i>
During recent years the interest of optimization and machine learning communities in high-probability convergence of stochastic optimization methods has been growing. One of the main reasons for this is that high-probability complexity bounds are more accurate and less studied than in-expectation ones. However, SOTA high-probability non-asymptotic convergence results are derived under strong assumptions such as the boundedness of the gradient noise variance or of the objective's gradient itself. In this paper, we propose several algorithms with high-probability convergence results under less restrictive assumptions. In particular, we derive new high-probability convergence results under the assumption that the gradient/operator noise has bounded central α-th moment for α∈(1,2] in the following setups: (i) smooth non-convex / Polyak-Lojasiewicz / convex / strongly convex / quasi-strongly convex minimization problems, (ii) Lipschitz / star-cocoercive and monotone / quasi-strongly monotone variational inequalities. These results justify the usage of the considered methods for solving problems that do not fit standard functional classes studied in stochastic optimization.

"Convergence of First-Order Algorithms for Meta-Learning with Moreau Envelopes"</a> -

Abstract:
<i>
In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the sum of Moreau envelopes of given functions, which has previously appeared in the context of meta-learning and personalized federated learning. In contrast to the existing theory that requires running subsolvers until a certain precision is reached, we only assume that a finite number of gradient steps is taken at each iteration. As a special case, our theory allows us to show the convergence of First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FO-MAML) to the vicinity of a solution of Moreau objective. We also study a more general family of first-order algorithms that can be viewed as a generalization of FO-MAML. Our main theoretical achievement is a theoretical improvement upon the inexact SGD framework. In particular, our perturbed-iterate analysis allows for tighter guarantees that improve the dependency on the problem's conditioning. In contrast to the related work on meta-learning, ours does not require any assumptions on the Hessian smoothness, and can leverage smoothness and convexity of the reformulation based on Moreau envelopes. Furthermore, to fill the gaps in the comparison of FO-MAML to the Implicit MAML (iMAML), we show that the objective of iMAML is neither smooth nor convex, implying that it has no convergence guarantees based on the existing theory.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
The celebrated FedAvg algorithm of McMahan et al. (2017) is based on three components: client sampling (CS), data sampling (DS) and local training (LT). While the first two are reasonably well understood, the third component, whose role is to reduce the number of communication rounds needed to train the model, resisted all attempts at a satisfactory theoretical explanation. Malinovsky et al. (2022) identified four distinct generations of LT methods based on the quality of the provided theoretical communication complexity guarantees. Despite a lot of progress in this area, none of the existing works were able to show that it is theoretically better to employ multiple local gradient-type steps (i.e., to engage in LT) than to rely on a single local gradient-type step only in the important heterogeneous data regime. In a recent breakthrough embodied in their ProxSkip method and its theoretical analysis, Mishchenko et al. (2022) showed that LT indeed leads to provable communication acceleration for arbitrarily heterogeneous data, thus jump-starting the 5th generation of LT methods. However, while these latest generation LT methods are compatible with DS, none of them support CS. We resolve this open problem in the affirmative. In order to do so, we had to base our algorithmic development on new algorithmic and theoretical foundations.

"Adaptive Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training"</a> -

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
We propose Adaptive Compressed Gradient Descent (AdaCGD) - a novel optimization algorithm for communication-efficient training of supervised machine learning models with adaptive compression level. Our approach is inspired by the recently proposed three point compressor (3PC) framework of Richtarik et al. (2022), which includes error feedback (EF21), lazily aggregated gradient (LAG), and their combination as special cases, and offers the current state-of-the-art rates for these methods under weak assumptions. While the above mechanisms offer a fixed compression level, or adapt between two extremes only, our proposal is to perform a much finer adaptation. In particular, we allow the user to choose any number of arbitrarily chosen contractive compression mechanisms, such as Top-K sparsification with a user-defined selection of sparsification levels K, or quantization with a user-defined selection of quantization levels, or their combination. AdaCGD chooses the appropriate compressor and compression level adaptively during the optimization process. Besides i) proposing a theoretically-grounded multi-adaptive communication compression mechanism, we further ii) extend the 3PC framework to bidirectional compression, i.e., we allow the server to compress as well, and iii) provide sharp convergence bounds in the strongly convex, convex and nonconvex settings. The convex regime results are new even for several key special cases of our general mechanism, including 3PC and EF21. In all regimes, our rates are superior compared to all existing adaptive compression methods.

In this paper, we present the first stepsize schedule for Newton method resulting in fast global and local convergence guarantees. In particular, a) we prove an $O(1/k^2)$ global rate, which matches the state-of-the-art global rate of cubically regularized Newton method of Polyak and Nesterov (2006) and of regularized Newton method of Mishchenko (2021) and Doikov and Nesterov (2021), b) we prove a local quadratic rate, which matches the best-known local rate of second-order methods, and c) our stepsize formula is simple, explicit, and does not require solving any subproblem. Our convergence proofs hold under affine-invariance assumptions closely related to the notion of self-concordance. Finally, our method has competitive performance when compared to existing baselines, which share the same fast global convergence guarantees.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In this work, we study distributed optimization algorithms that reduce the high communication costs of synchronization by allowing clients to perform multiple local gradient steps in each communication round. Recently, Mishchenko et al. (2022) proposed a new type of local method, called ProxSkip, that enjoys an accelerated communication complexity without any data similarity condition. However, their method requires all clients to call local gradient oracles with the same frequency. Because of statistical heterogeneity, we argue that clients with well-conditioned local problems should compute their local gradients less frequently than clients with ill-conditioned local problems. Our first contribution is the extension of the original ProxSkip method to the setup where clients are allowed to perform a different number of local gradient steps in each communication round. We prove that our modified method, GradSkip, still converges linearly, has the same accelerated communication complexity, and the required frequency for local gradient computations is proportional to the local condition number. Next, we generalize our method by extending the randomness of probabilistic alternations to arbitrary unbiased compression operators and considering a generic proximable regularizer. This generalization, GradSkip+, recovers several related methods in the literature. Finally, we present an empirical study to confirm our theoretical claims.

"Provably Doubly Accelerated Federated Learning: The First Theoretically Successful Combination of Local Training and Compressed Communication"</a> -
joint work with
<a href="https://lcondat.github.io">Laurent Condat</a> and <a href="https://kinit.sk/member/ivan-agarsky/">Ivan Agarský</a>.


<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In the modern paradigm of federated learning, a large number of users are involved in a global learning task, in a collaborative way. They alternate local computations and two-way communication with a distant orchestrating server. Communication, which can be slow and costly, is the main bottleneck in this setting. To reduce the communication load and therefore accelerate distributed gradient descent, two strategies are popular: 1) communicate less frequently; that is, perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds; and 2) communicate compressed information instead of full-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm for distributed optimization and federated learning, which harnesses these two strategies jointly and converges linearly to an exact solution, with a doubly accelerated rate: our algorithm benefits from the two acceleration mechanisms provided by local training and compression, namely a better dependency on the condition number of the functions and on the dimension of the model, respectively.

"Improved Stein Variational Gradient Descent with Importance Weights"</a> -
joint work with
<a href="https://lukangsun.github.io">Lukang Sun</a>.


<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Stein Variational Gradient Descent~(SVGD) is a popular sampling algorithm used in various machine learning tasks. It is well known that SVGD arises from a discretization of the kernelized gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{KL}(\cdot\mid\pi)$, where $\pi$ is the target distribution. In this work, we propose to enhance SVGD via the introduction of  importance weights, which leads to a new method for which we coin the name $\beta$-SVGD. In the continuous time and infinite particles regime, the time for this flow to converge to the equilibrium distribution $\pi$, quantified by the Stein Fisher information, depends on $\rho_0$ and $\pi$ very weakly. This is very different from the kernelized gradient flow of Kullback-Leibler divergence, whose time complexity depends on $D_{KL}(\rho_0\mid\pi)$. Under certain assumptions, we provide a descent lemma for the population limit $\beta$-SVGD, which covers the descent lemma for the population limit SVGD when $\beta\to 0$. We also illustrate the advantages of $\beta$-SVGD over SVGD by simple experiments.

"EF21-P and Friends: Improved Theoretical Communication Complexity for Distributed Optimization with Bidirectional Compression"</a> -
joint work with
Kaja Gruntkowska and <a href="https://k3nfalt.github.io">Alexander Tyurin</a>.


<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
The starting point of this paper is the discovery of a novel and simple error-feedback mechanism, which we call EF21-P, for dealing with the error introduced by a contractive compressor. Unlike all prior works on error feedback, where compression and correction operate in the dual space of gradients, our mechanism operates in the primal space of models. While we believe that EF21-P may be of interest in many situations where it is often advantageous to perform model perturbation prior to the computation of the gradient (e.g., randomized smoothing and generalization), in this work we focus our attention on its use as a key building block in the design of communication-efficient distributed optimization methods supporting bidirectional compression. In particular, we employ EF21-P as the mechanism for compressing and subsequently error-correcting the model broadcast by the server to the workers. By combining EF21-P with suitable methods performing worker-to-server compression, we obtain novel methods supporting bidirectional compression and enjoying new state-of-the-art theoretical communication complexity for convex and nonconvex problems. For example, our bounds are the first that manage to decouple the variance/error coming from the workers-to-server and server-to-workers compression, transforming a multiplicative dependence to an additive one. In the convex regime, we obtain the first bounds that match the theoretical communication complexity of gradient descent. Even in this convex regime, our algorithms work with biased gradient estimators, which is non-standard and requires new proof techniques that may be of independent interest. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated through suitable experiments.

<br>

Abstract:
<i>
In this paper, we propose a new zero order optimization method called minibatch stochastic three points (MiSTP) method to solve an unconstrained minimization problem in a setting where only an approximation of the objective function evaluation is possible. It is based on the recently proposed stochastic three points (STP) method (Bergou et al., 2020). At each iteration, MiSTP generates a random search direction in a similar manner to STP, but chooses the next iterate based solely on the approximation of the objective function rather than its exact evaluations. We also analyze our method's complexity in the nonconvex and convex cases and evaluate its performance on multiple machine learning tasks.

Abstract:
<i>
In contrast to training traditional machine learning (ML) models in data centers, federated learning (FL) trains ML models over local datasets contained on resource-constrained heterogeneous edge devices. Existing FL algorithms aim to learn a single global model for all participating devices, which may not be helpful to all devices participating in the training due to the heterogeneity of the data across the devices. Recently, Hanzely and Richtárik (2020) proposed a new formulation for training personalized FL models aimed at balancing the trade-off between the traditional global model and the local models that could be trained by individual devices using their private data only. They derived a new algorithm, called Loopless Gradient Descent (L2GD), to solve it and showed that this algorithms leads to improved communication complexity guarantees in regimes when more personalization is required. In this paper, we equip their L2GD algorithm with a bidirectional compression mechanism to further reduce the communication bottleneck between the local devices and the server. Unlike other compression-based algorithms used in the FL-setting, our compressed L2GD algorithm operates on a probabilistic communication protocol, where communication does not happen on a fixed schedule. Moreover, our compressed L2GD algorithm maintains a similar convergence rate as vanilla SGD without compression. To empirically validate the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform diverse numerical experiments on both convex and non-convex problems and using various compression techniques.

"Adaptive Learning Rates for Faster Stochastic Gradient Methods"</a> -
joint work with
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath">Samuel Horváth</a> and <a href="https://www.konstmish.com">Konstantin Mishchenko</a>.


<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In this work, we propose new adaptive step size strategies that improve several stochastic gradient methods. Our first method (StoPS) is based on the classical Polyak step size (Polyak, 1987) and is an extension of the recent development of this method for the stochastic optimization-SPS (Loizou et al., 2021), and our second method, denoted GraDS, rescales step size by "diversity of stochastic gradients". We provide a theoretical analysis of these methods for strongly convex smooth functions and show they enjoy deterministic-like rates despite stochastic gradients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the theoretical superiority of our adaptive methods on quadratic objectives. Unfortunately, both StoPS and GraDS depend on unknown quantities, which are only practical for the overparametrized models. To remedy this, we drop this undesired dependence and redefine StoPS and GraDS to StoP and GraD, respectively. We show that these new methods converge linearly to the neighbourhood of the optimal solution under the same assumptions. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical claims by experimental validation, which reveals that GraD is particularly useful for deep learning optimization.

"RandProx: Primal-Dual Optimization Algorithms with Randomized Proximal Updates"</a> -
joint work with
<a href="https://lcondat.github.io">Laurent Condat</a>.


<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Proximal splitting algorithms are well suited to solving large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems, in particular those arising in machine learning. We propose a new primal-dual algorithm, in which the dual update is randomized; equivalently, the proximity operator of one of the function in the problem is replaced by a stochastic oracle. For instance, some randomly chosen dual variables, instead of all, are updated at each iteration. Or, the proximity operator of a function is called with some small probability only. A nonsmooth variance-reduction technique is implemented so that the algorithm finds an exact minimizer of the general problem involving smooth and nonsmooth functions, possibly composed with linear operators. We derive linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity; these results are new even in the deterministic case, when our algorithms reverts to the recently proposed Primal-Dual Davis-Yin algorithm. Some randomized algorithms of the literature are also recovered as particular cases (e.g., Point-SAGA). But our randomization technique is general and encompasses many unbiased mechanisms beyond sampling and probabilistic updates, including compression. Since the convergence speed depends on the slowest among the primal and dual contraction mechanisms, the iteration complexity might remain the same when randomness is used. On the other hand, the computation complexity can be significantly reduced. Overall, randomness helps getting faster algorithms. This has long been known for stochastic-gradient-type algorithms, and our work shows that this fully applies in the more general primal-dual setting as well.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
We study distributed optimization methods based on the local training (LT) paradigm: achieving communication efficiency
by performing richer local gradient-based training on the clients before  parameter averaging.  Looking back at the progress
of the field, we identify 5 generations of LT methods: 1) heuristic, 2) homogeneous, 3) sublinear, 4) linear, and 5) accelerated.
The 5th generation, initiated by the ProxSkip method of Mishchenko, Malinovsky, Stich and Richtárik (2022) and its analysis,
is characterized by the first theoretical confirmation that  LT is a communication  acceleration mechanism. Inspired by this recent
progress, we contribute to the 5th generation of LT methods by showing that it is possible to enhance them further using
variance reduction. While all previous theoretical results for LT methods ignore the cost of local work altogether, and are framed
purely in terms of the number of communication rounds, we show that our methods can be substantially faster in terms of the
total training cost than the state-of-the-art method ProxSkip in theory and practice in the regime when local computation is
sufficiently expensive. We characterize this threshold theoretically, and confirm our theoretical predictions with empirical results.

<h1>New Research Intern: Michał Grudzień (Oxford)</h1>
<br>


Let us all welcome <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michał-grudzień-2141a2198/?originalSubdomain=uk">Michał Grudzień</a> to the team as a new VSRP research intern! Michal arrived to KAUST yesterday.
Michał tudies toward an MA degree in Mathematics and Statistics at Oxford University. He is the recipient of the
<a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/fees-and-funding/oxford-support/palgrave-brown-scholarship-non-uk">Palgrave Brown Scholarship</a>. Prior to this, Michal studied in Warsaw, Poland, at the famous Stanislaw Staszic Lyceum.
Some of Michał's achievements:
<ul>
<li>Member of a project for Oxford "Engineers without borders" society (classification and segmentation on Kaggle), 2021-now </li>
<li> Research Internship with Yaodong Yang on bilevel optimization, 2021</li>
<li>Finalist and Laureate in National Mathematical Olympiad, Poland, 2018 and 2019</li>
<li>Volunteer for Women in Tech Summit II, 2018-2019</li>
<li>Semi-Finalist in the Physics Olympiad, Poland, 2018</li>
<li>Laureate and Finalist in Junior Mathematical Olympiad, Poland, 2016 and 2017</li>

<br>
Abstract:
<i>
  Inspired by a recent breakthrough of Mishchenko et al. (2022), who for the first time showed that local gradient steps
  can lead to provable communication acceleration, we propose an alternative algorithm which obtains the same communication
  acceleration as their method (ProxSkip). Our approach is very different, however: it is based on the celebrated method of
  Chambolle and Pock (2011), with several nontrivial modifications: i) we allow for an inexact computation of the prox operator
  of a certain smooth strongly convex function via a suitable gradient-based method (e.g., GD, Fast GD or FSFOM), ii) we perform
  a careful modification of the dual update step in order to retain linear convergence. Our general results offer the new
  state-of-the-art rates for the class of strongly convex-concave saddle-point problems with bilinear coupling characterized
  by the absence of smoothness in the dual function. When applied to federated learning, we obtain a theoretically better
  alternative to ProxSkip: our method requires fewer local steps (O(κ^{1/3}) or O(κ^{1/4}), compared to O(κ^{1/2}) of ProxSkip),
  and performs a deterministic number of local steps instead. Like ProxSkip, our method can be applied to optimization over a
  connected network, and we obtain theoretical improvements here as well.

Abstract:
<i>
Communication is one of the key bottlenecks in the distributed training of large-scale machine learning models, and lossy compression of exchanged information, such as stochastic gradients or models, is one of the most effective instruments to alleviate this issue. Among the most studied compression techniques is the class of unbiased compression operators with variance bounded by a multiple of the square norm of the vector we wish to compress. By design, this variance may remain high, and only diminishes if the input vector approaches zero. However, unless the model being trained is overparameterized, there is no a-priori reason for the vectors we wish to compress to approach zero during the iterations of classical methods such as distributed compressed SGD, which has adverse effects on the convergence speed. Due to this issue, several more elaborate and seemingly very different algorithms have been proposed recently, with the goal of circumventing this issue. These methods are based on the idea of compressing the difference between the vector we would normally wish to compress and some auxiliary vector which changes throughout the iterative process. In this work we take a step back, and develop a unified framework for studying such methods, conceptually, and theoretically. Our framework incorporates methods compressing both gradients and models, using unbiased and biased compressors, and sheds light on the construction of the auxiliary vectors. Furthermore, our general framework can lead to the improvement of several existing algorithms, and can produce new algorithms. Finally, we performed several numerical experiments which illustrate and support our theoretical findings.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In this note, we establish a descent lemma for the population limit Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Method (MSVGD).
This descent lemma does not rely on the path information of MSVGD but rather on a simple assumption for the mirrored distribution.
Our analysis demonstrates that MSVGD can be applied to a broader class of constrained sampling problems with non-smooth V. We also
investigate the complexity of the population limit MSVGD in terms of dimension d.</i>

Abstract:
<i>
Gradient compression is a popular technique for improving communication complexity of stochastic first-order methods in distributed training of machine learning models. However, the existing works consider only with-replacement sampling of stochastic gradients. In contrast, it is well-known in practice and recently confirmed in theory that stochastic methods based on without-replacement sampling, e.g., Random Reshuffling (RR) method, perform better than ones that sample the gradients with-replacement. In this work, we close this gap in the literature and provide the first analysis of methods with gradient compression and without-replacement sampling. We first develop a distributed variant of random reshuffling with gradient compression (Q-RR), and show how to reduce the variance coming from gradient quantization through the use of control iterates. Next, to have a better fit to Federated Learning applications, we incorporate local computation and propose a variant of Q-RR called Q-NASTYA. Q-NASTYA uses local gradient steps and different local and global stepsizes. Next, we show how to reduce compression variance in this setting as well. Finally, we prove the convergence results for the proposed methods and outline several settings in which they improve upon existing algorithms.

Abstract:
<i>
Despite their high computation and communication costs, Newton-type methods remain an appealing option for distributed training due to their robustness against ill-conditioned convex problems. In this work, we study ommunication compression and aggregation mechanisms for curvature information in order to reduce these costs while preserving theoretically superior local convergence guarantees. We prove that the recently developed class of three point compressors (3PC) of Richtarik et al. [2022] for gradient communication can be generalized to Hessian communication as well. This result opens up a wide variety of communication strategies, such as contractive compression} and lazy aggregation, available to our disposal to compress prohibitively costly curvature information. Moreover, we discovered several new 3PC mechanisms, such as adaptive thresholding and Bernoulli aggregation, which require reduced communication and occasional Hessian computations. Furthermore, we extend and analyze our approach to bidirectional communication compression and partial device participation setups to cater to the practical considerations of applications in federated learning. For all our methods, we derive fast condition-number-independent local linear and/or superlinear convergence rates. Finally, with extensive numerical evaluations on convex optimization problems, we illustrate that our designed schemes achieve state-of-the-art communication complexity compared to several key baselines using second-order information.

Abstract:
<i>
Federated learning has recently gained significant attention and popularity due to its effectiveness in training machine learning models on distributed data privately. However, as in the single-node supervised learning setup, models trained in federated learning suffer from vulnerability to imperceptible input transformations known as adversarial attacks, questioning their deployment in security-related applications. In this work, we study the interplay between federated training, personalization, and certified robustness. In particular, we deploy randomized smoothing, a widely-used and scalable certification method, to certify deep networks trained on a federated setup against input perturbations and transformations. We find that the simple federated averaging technique is effective in building not only more accurate, but also more certifiably-robust models, compared to training solely on local data. We further analyze personalization, a popular technique in federated training that increases the model's bias towards local data, on robustness. We show several advantages of personalization over both~(that is, only training on local data and federated training) in building more robust models with faster training. Finally, we explore the robustness of mixtures of global and local~(\ie personalized) models, and find that the robustness of local models degrades as they diverge from the global model

Abstract:
<i>
We revisit the classical problem of finding an approximately stationary point of the average of n smooth and possibly nonconvex functions.
The optimal complexity of stochastic first-order methods in terms of the number of gradient evaluations of individual functions is
O(n+√n/ε), attained by the optimal SGD methods 𝖲𝖯𝖨𝖣𝖤𝖱 [Fang et al, NeurIPS 2018] and 𝖯𝖠𝖦𝖤 [Zhize et al, ICML 2021], for example,
where ε is the error tolerance. However, i) the big-O notation hides crucial dependencies on the smoothness constants associated with the functions,
and ii) the rates and theory in these methods assume simplistic sampling mechanisms that do not offer any flexibility. In this work we remedy the
situation. First, we generalize the 𝖯𝖠𝖦𝖤 algorithm so that it can provably work with virtually any (unbiased) sampling mechanism. This is particularly
useful in federated learning, as it allows us to construct and better understand the impact of various combinations of client and data sampling strategies.
Second, our analysis is sharper as we make explicit use of certain novel inequalities that capture the intricate interplay between the smoothness
constants and the sampling procedure. Indeed, our analysis is better even for the simple sampling procedure analyzed in the 𝖯𝖠𝖦𝖤 paper.
However, this already improved bound can be further sharpened by a different sampling scheme which we propose. In summary, we provide the most
general and most accurate analysis of optimal SGD in the smooth nonconvex regime. Finally, our theoretical findings are supposed with carefully
designed experiments.

Abstract:
<i>
Federated learning uses a set of techniques to efficiently distribute the training of a machine learning algorithm across several devices, who own the training data. These techniques critically rely on reducing the communication cost -- the main bottleneck -- between the devices and a central server. Federated learning algorithms usually take an optimization approach: they are algorithms for minimizing the training loss subject to communication (and other) constraints. In this work, we instead take a Bayesian approach for the training task, and propose a communication-efficient variant of the Langevin algorithm to sample a posteriori. The latter approach is more robust and provides more knowledge of the \textit{a posteriori} distribution than its optimization counterpart. We analyze our algorithm without assuming that the target distribution is strongly log-concave. Instead, we assume the weaker log Sobolev inequality, which allows for nonconvexity.

Abstract:
<i>
Byzantine-robustness has been gaining a lot of attention due to the growth of the interest in collaborative and federated learning.
However, many fruitful directions, such as the usage of variance reduction for achieving robustness and communication compression
for reducing communication costs, remain weakly explored in the field. This work addresses this gap and proposes Byz-VR-MARINA --
a new Byzantine-tolerant method with variance reduction and compression. A key message of our paper is that variance reduction is
key to fighting Byzantine workers more effectively. At the same time, communication compression is a bonus that makes the process
more communication efficient. We derive theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state of the art
for general non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz loss functions. Unlike the concurrent Byzantine-robust methods with variance reduction
and/or compression, our complexity results are tight and do not rely on restrictive assumptions such as boundedness of the gradients
or limited compression. Moreover, we provide the first analysis of a Byzantine-tolerant method supporting non-uniform sampling of
stochastic gradients. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is an important alternative to the Langevin-type algorithms for sampling from probability
distributions of the form π(x)∝exp(−V(x)). In the existing theory of Langevin-type algorithms and SVGD, the potential function V is
often assumed to be L-smooth. However, this restrictive condition excludes a large class of potential functions such as polynomials
of degree greater than 2. Our paper studies the convergence of the SVGD algorithm for distributions with (L0,L1)-smooth potentials.
This relaxed smoothness assumption was introduced by Zhang et al. [2019a] for the analysis of gradient clipping algorithms. With the
help of trajectory-independent auxiliary conditions, we provide a descent lemma establishing that the algorithm decreases the KL divergence
at each iteration and prove a complexity bound for SVGD in the population limit in terms of the Stein Fisher information.

We present a new method that includes three key components of distributed optimization and federated learning: variance reduction of stochastic gradients, compressed communication, and partial participation. We prove that the new method has optimal oracle complexity and state-of-the-art communication complexity in the partial participation setting. Moreover, we observe that "1 + 1 + 1 is not 3": by mixing variance reduction of stochastic gradients with compressed communication and partial participation, we do not obtain a fully synergetic effect. We explain the nature of this phenomenon, argue that this is to be expected, and propose possible workarounds.

"EF-BV: A Unified Theory of Error Feedback and Variance Reduction Mechanisms for Biased and Unbiased Compression in Distributed Optimization"</a> -
joint work with

<a href="https://kaiyi.me">Kai Yi</a>.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
In distributed or federated optimization and learning, communication between the different computing units is often the bottleneck, and gradient compression is a widely used technique for reducing the number of bits sent within each communication round of iterative methods. There are two classes of compression operators and separate algorithms making use of them. In the case of unbiased random compressors with bounded variance (e.g., rand-k), the DIANA algorithm of Mishchenko et al. [2019], which implements a variance reduction technique for handling the variance introduced by compression, is the current state of the art. In the case of biased and contractive compressors (e.g., top-k), the EF21 algorithm of Richtárik et al. [2021], which implements an error-feedback mechanism for handling the error introduced by compression, is the current state of the art. These two classes of compression schemes and algorithms are distinct, with different analyses and proof techniques. In this paper, we unify them into a single framework and propose a new algorithm, recovering DIANA and EF21 as particular cases. We prove linear convergence under certain conditions. Our general approach works with a new, larger class of compressors, which includes unbiased and biased compressors as particular cases, and has two parameters, the bias and the variance. These gives a finer control and allows us to inherit the best of the two worlds: biased compressors, whose good performance in practice is recognized, can be used. And independent randomness at the compressors allows to mitigate the effects of compression, with the convergence rate improving when the number of parallel workers is large. This is the first time that an algorithm with all these features is proposed. Our approach takes a step towards better understanding of two so-far distinct worlds of communication-efficient distributed learning.

"Federated Random Reshuffling with Compression and Variance Reduction"</a> -
joint work with <a href="https://grigory-malinovsky.github.io">Grigory Malinovsky</a>.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
Random Reshuffling (RR), which is a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) employing sampling without replacement, is an immensely popular method for training supervised machine learning models via empirical risk minimization. Due to its superior practical performance, it is embedded and often set as default in standard machine learning software. Under the name FedRR, this method was recently shown to be applicable to federated learning (Mishchenko et al.,2021), with superior performance when compared to common baselines such as Local SGD. Inspired by this development, we design three new algorithms to improve FedRR further: compressed FedRR and two variance reduced extensions: one for taming the variance coming from shuffling and the other for taming the variance due to compression. The variance reduction mechanism for compression allows us to eliminate dependence on the compression parameter, and applying additional controlled linear perturbations for Random Reshuffling, introduced by Malinovsky et al.(2021) helps to eliminate variance at the optimum. We provide the first analysis of compressed local methods under standard assumptions without bounded gradient assumptions and for heterogeneous data, overcoming the limitations of the compression operator. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real data sets.

Abstract:
<i>
The practice of applying several local updates before aggregation across clients has been empirically shown to be a successful approach to overcoming the communication bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL). In this work, we propose a general recipe, FedShuffle, that better utilizes the local updates in FL, especially in the heterogeneous regime. Unlike many prior works, FedShuffle does not assume any uniformity in the number of updates per device. Our FedShuffle recipe comprises four simple-yet-powerful ingredients: 1) local shuffling of the data, 2) adjustment of the local learning rates, 3) update weighting, and 4) momentum variance reduction (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2019). We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedShuffle and show that both theoretically and empirically, our approach does not suffer from the objective function mismatch that is present in FL methods which assume homogeneous updates in heterogeneous FL setups, e.g., FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017). In addition, by combining the ingredients above, FedShuffle improves upon FedNova (Wang et al., 2020), which was previously proposed to solve this mismatch. We also show that FedShuffle with momentum variance reduction can improve upon non-local methods under a Hessian similarity assumption. Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we illustrate how each of the four ingredients used in FedShuffle helps improve the use of local updates in FL.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
We introduce ProxSkip---a surprisingly simple and provably efficient method for minimizing the sum of a smooth ($f$) and an expensive nonsmooth proximable ($\psi$) function. The canonical approach to solving such problems is via the proximal gradient descent (ProxGD) algorithm, which is based on the evaluation of the gradient of $f$ and the prox operator  of $\psi$ in each iteration. In this work we are specifically interested in the regime in which the evaluation of prox is costly relative to the evaluation of the gradient, which is the case in many applications. ProxSkip allows for the expensive prox operator to be skipped in most iterations: while its iteration complexity is $\cO(\kappa \log \nicefrac{1}{\varepsilon})$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of $f$, the number of prox evaluations is $\cO(\sqrt{\kappa} \log \nicefrac{1}{\varepsilon})$ only. Our main motivation comes from federated learning, where evaluation of the gradient operator corresponds to taking a local GD step independently on all devices, and evaluation of prox corresponds to (expensive) communication in the form of gradient averaging. In this context, ProxSkip offers an effective <i>acceleration</i> of communication complexity. Unlike other local gradient-type methods, such as FedAvg, Scaffold, S-Local-GD and FedLin, whose theoretical communication complexity is worse than, or at best matching, that of vanilla GD in the heterogeneous data regime, we obtain a provable and large improvement without any heterogeneity-bounding assumptions.

<i>
Variational inequalities are a formalism that includes games, minimization, saddle point, and equilibrium problems as special cases. Methods for variational inequalities are therefore universal approaches for many applied tasks, including machine learning problems. This work concentrates on the decentralized setting, which is increasingly important but not well understood. In particular, we consider decentralized stochastic (sum-type) variational inequalities over fixed and time-varying networks. We present lower complexity bounds for both communication and local iterations and construct optimal algorithms that match these lower bounds. Our algorithms are the best among the available literature not only in the decentralized stochastic case, but also in the decentralized deterministic and non-distributed stochastic cases. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the presented algorithms.

<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
We develop and analyze DASHA: a new family of methods for nonconvex distributed optimization problems. When the local functions at the nodes have a finite-sum
or an expectation form, our new methods, DASHA-PAGE and DASHA-SYNC-MVR, improve the theoretical oracle and communication complexity of the previous state-of-the-art method MARINA by
Gorbunov et al. (2020). In particular, to achieve an $\varepsilon$-stationary point, and considering the random sparsifier RandK as an
example, our methods compute the optimal number of gradients $O(\sqrt{m}/(\varepsilon\sqrt{n}))$ and $O(\sigma/(\varepsilon^{3/2}n))$ in finite-sum and
expectation form cases, respectively, while maintaining the SOTA communication complexity $O(d/(\varepsilon \sqrt{n}))$. Furthermore, unlike
MARINA, the new methods DASHA, DASHA-PAGE and DASHA-MVR send compressed vectors only and never synchronize the nodes, which makes them more practical for federated learning. We extend our results to the case when the functions satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition.
Finally, our theory is corroborated in practice: we see a significant improvement in experiments with nonconvex classification and training of deep learning models.

Abstract:
<i>
We propose and study a new class of gradient communication mechanisms for communication-efficient training -- three point compressors (3PC) -- as well as efficient distributed nonconvex optimization algorithms that can take advantage of them. Unlike most established approaches, which rely on a static compressor choice (e.g., Top-K), our class allows the compressors to {\em evolve} throughout the training process, with the aim of improving the theoretical communication complexity and practical efficiency of the underlying methods. We show that our general approach can recover the recently proposed state-of-the-art error feedback mechanism EF21 (Richtárik et al., 2021) and its theoretical properties as a special case, but also leads to a number of new efficient methods. Notably, our approach allows us to improve upon the state of the art in the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of the lazy aggregation literature (Chen et al., 2018). As a by-product that may be of independent interest, we provide a new and fundamental link between the lazy aggregation and error feedback literature. A special feature of our work is that we do not require the compressors to be unbiased.

"Server-side stepsizes and sampling without replacement provably help in federated optimization"</a> -
joint work with

<a href="https://konstmish.github.io">Konstantin Mishchenko</a>.
<br>
<br>
Abstract:
<i>
We present a theoretical study of server-side optimization in federated learning. Our results are the first to show that the widely popular heuristic of scaling the client updates with an extra parameter is very useful in the context of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with local passes over the client data. Each local pass is performed without replacement using Random Reshuffling, which is a key reason we can show improved complexities. In particular, we prove that whenever the local stepsizes are small, and the update direction is given by FedAvg in conjunction with Random Reshuffling over all clients, one can take a big leap in the obtained direction and improve rates for convex, strongly convex, and non-convex objectives. In particular, in non-convex regime we get an enhancement of the rate of convergence from $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ to $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. This result is new even for Random Reshuffling performed on a single node. In contrast, if the local stepsizes are large, we prove that the noise of client sampling can be controlled by using a small server-side stepsize. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that local steps provably help to overcome the communication bottleneck. Together, our results on the advantage of large and small server-side stepsizes give a formal justification for the practice of adaptive server-side optimization in federated learning. Moreover, we consider a variant of our algorithm that supports partial client participation, which makes the method more practical.
